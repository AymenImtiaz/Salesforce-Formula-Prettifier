# Salesforce Formula Prettifier

A Lightning Web Component tool that helps Salesforce Admins visualize, understand, and evaluate formula fields in a clean, readable format.

## What Does This Tool Do?

Formula fields in Salesforce can become complex and difficult to read, especially when they contain nested functions and long field references. This tool:

- **Prettifies formulas** - Formats your formula fields with proper indentation and syntax highlighting
- **Evaluates results** - Shows you the actual calculated value for a specific record
- **Supports two modes**:
  - **Select Mode**: Choose an object and field from dropdowns
  - **Paste Mode**: Copy and paste any formula directly

## Security & Permissions

This tool respects Salesforce security:
- **Object-Level Security**: You can only see objects you have access to
- **Field-Level Security**: You can only see formula fields you have permission to view

The tool uses Salesforce's built-in security enforcement to ensure you only access data you're authorized to see.

## Installation

Open the [Installation Link](https://linkly.link/2HjLA), login to your org and follow the installation wizard to add this tool to your Salesforce org. Replace 'login.salesforce.com' with 'test.salesforce.com' for sandboxes.
